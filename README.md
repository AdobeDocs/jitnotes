# JitNotes — A release notes generator

This CLI fetches Jira tickets and finds the corresponding GitHub PRs to generate a release notes markdown file.

The CLI asks you a series of questions that it uses to generate the release notes. The questions are:

1. **Jira name** for project (PWA, USF, COMDOX).
2. **Release version** number (Major.Minor.Patch).
3. **Previous version** number (Major.Minor.Patch).
4. **Type** of ticket to include (Story, Bug, etc.)
5. **Status** of tickets to include (Open, In Progress, Done, etc.)
6. **Start date** for including GitHub PRs merged on and after the date.
7. **End date** for including GitHub PRs merged on and before the date.
8. **JIRA API token** for fetching the tickets that match the criteria.
9. **GitHub API token** for fetching the PRs that correspond to the tickets.

## Release notes template

The current (and only) release notes template is specific to the PWA Studio project. Later, we will add different project templates that are specific to the wants of needs of other teams. (D)
The PWA Studio template provides the following sections:

- **Highlights** — Requires manual content updates based on the code and documentation changes.
- **Code changes** — Autogenerated content from Jira tickets and related GitHub PRs.
- **Documentation changes** — Autogenerated content from Jira tickets and related GitHub PRs.
- **Known issues** — Requires manual content updates.
- **Lighthouse scores** — Requires manual content updates of the scores and SVG graphics.
- **Upgrading from previous versions** — Static content. No changes required.
- **Updated package dependencies** — Requires manual content updates.

**NOTE**: The CLI autogenerates all Jira ticket and GitHub PR links at the bottom of the template.

## Prerequisites

To run this CLI, you need the following access tokens for Jira and GitHub:

- Jira API Access Token (see [JIRA API Account Access](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/JIRA/API+Account+Access)).
- GitHub Personal Access Token (see [Creating a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)).

## Usage

1. Open a terminal shell in your project directory.
2. Run `npx jitnotes` and follow the CLI prompts.

The CLI will generate a new `CHANGELOG.md` file in the current directory.
